{"name":"Encoded Curtain","body":"### Welcome to Encoded Curtain.\r\n\r\n“Encoded Curtain” is an extremely minimalist Omeka theme meant to temporarily restrict access to your data. Sometimes marking items as “private” isn’t enough; if you’re going to have everything marked as “private” for several months before releasing a site, you might want to let authenticated users add data through the site’s dashboard without your front-end touting zero public items or otherwise looking empty. Maybe you’re developing a theme but want to start adding items through a public URL, for example. Accessing the front-end with the Encoded Curtain theme activated shows you a single, minimal page that lets users with site accounts log into the dashboard and work there as normal.\r\n\r\nView this theme on Omeka.org at http://omeka.org/add-ons/themes/encoded-curtain/","tagline":"A back-end only theme to let users add items via a private Omeka site before going public","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
